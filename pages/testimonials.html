                            Most of my friends and I have never seen ourselves as photogenic - but he managed to capture

                        <p>"I could not have been happier with Aidan as my photographer for my Nikkah day. He was always
                            very responsive and spoke with me in detail before my event to get an idea of what my vision
                            was
                            and the kind of photos I wanted. On the actual event day, he really did an amazing job in
                            capturing everything that I wanted, from the decor to the guests to the small intimate
                            moments
                            that matter. He was very easy to talk to and made my husband and I feel very comfortable
                            while
                            taking our solo shots as well. He was also super quick in delivering all the edited photos
                            just
                            a few days after my event, and I was truly in love with how well each photo came out. If
                            you‚Äôre
                            thinking about booking a photographer for you event, I would highly recommend choosing

                        I had a blast taking my birthday photoshoot with Aidan! We chose Princeton as our location
                        because of
                        the many great backgrounds. As we were going around taking pictures, I always felt comfortable
                        and
                        confident in the poses that Aidan suggested. It was an eye-opening experience for my future
                        photoshoot
                        posing and the pictures came out really nicely with Aidan's edits.

                        "I had the privilege of working with Aidan for my wedding, and I cannot express enough gratitude
                        for his exceptional skills and professionalism. Aidan seamlessly blended punctuality with
                        flexibility, creating a stress-free environment. I had 99 problems to deal with during the event
                        and Aidan was not one of them.

                        His ability to be both present in the moment and discreetly capture beautiful memories is truly
                        commendable. My friends were pleasantly surprised by the candid shots he effortlessly took. What
                        sets Aidan apart is his willingness to engage with guests, going above and beyond to ensure
                        everyone felt included. He helped the guests taking pictures with their personal phones,
                        something I have not seen other photographers do. This act of kindness didn't go unnoticed, as
                        numerous friends requested his contact for their upcoming events. Aidan's talent and genuine
                        commitment to his craft make him a standout photographer, and I wholeheartedly recommend him for
                        any special occasion."

                        Aidan was an absolute pleasure to work with. From the pre-wedding talk about photograph ideas to
                        understanding what we were looking for, he was super friendly and easy to work with. On the day
                        of, he came early, worked vigilantly, and captured all the right shots, from emotional moments
                        to all the right family members and friends. All his pictures captured the love and happiness
                        from that day and I can't imagine having a better photographer, we genuinely love his work as
                        well as his amazing character!
