            <p><b>Want ALL your photos and not just the edited ones? </b>
               <br>I can do that!
            </p>

            <p><b>Feel awkward in front of the camera? </b>
               <br> I can help with that! I try my best to offer poses that feel natural and fun where it hardly
               feels like you’re posing at all!
            </p>

            <p><b>What else makes me different from other wedding photographers?</b>
               <br>
            </p>
            <ol>
               <li>
                  <b>1. Customer service:</b> I do everything I can to make any request possible and do everything I can
                  to make your day run as smooth as possible! As a testament to this, I'm proud to say I've NEVER had a
                  dissatisfied client!
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>2. Authentic & Emotional Storytelling:</b> I consider my style of wedding photography to be
                  photojournalistic, meaning I focus on documenting the genuine emotions and candid moments.
                  I do my best to bring out and capture laughter, natural interactions, spontaneous moments as they
                  unfold. This approach helps authentically
                  tell the unique story of your wedding day as well as evoke emotions that transport you back to the
                  moments captured in the images.

               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>3. Emphasis on People & Relationships:</b> Your
                  photos will place attention to the interactions, emotions, and connections between family members,
                  friends, and yourself. The resulting images reflect the genuine love, happiness, and warmth that
                  surround your day.
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b>4. Timeless & Natural Aesthetic:</b> By avoiding excessive or artificial styling, the images
                  represent meaningful and unadulterated moments that look and feel like what you experienced.
               </li>

                     Almost half of my trips are in the New York City and Long Island areas! I'm also open to
                     destination weddings (in other words, if would like to have your event/session far from New Jersey
                     and you can pay for my flight, the rest would be free of charge!)</p>

                     I can work with you on that! Just let me know when first reaching out! I understand not everyone
                     wants their intimate moments or family members on a photographer's website or social media.
                     I usually ask clients if they're comfortable with the
                     Please know that sharing photos on our social media or on our websites is how photographers are
                     able to reach new clients and display their work for others to view.
                     In order to offset these costs, I may have to ask for a small fee.

                     he came early, worked vigilantly, and captured all the right shots, from emotional moments to all
                     the right family members and friends. All his pictures captured the love and happiness from that
                     day and I can't imagine having a better photographer, we genuinely love his work as well as his
                     amazing character! </p>

                     Most of my friends and I have never seen ourselves as photogenic - but he managed to capture us
                     when we were having the most fun and making the best of memories, and in each picture we shined.

                  Thank you so so so so so so much aidan ❤ Such a blessing! Singlehandedly made this trip back to
                  jersey so worth it with all these pictures! We had a good amount of scene changes so we weren’t at
                  the same place for too long. I felt like you intervened at the right times and weren’t too
                  obtrusive. You were overall really helpful and you guided us really well tbh! If ur down to take
                  pics of us over the summer in a different location, that would be 🥰 I’d be down to pay whatever
                  cost it is!

                  I had a blast taking my birthday photoshoot with Aidan! We chose Princeton as our location because of
                  the many great backgrounds. As we were going around taking pictures, I always felt comfortable and
                  confident in the poses that Aidan suggested. It was an eye-opening experience for my future photoshoot
                  posing and the pictures came out really nicely with Aidan's edits.

                  Aidan took photos for my 23rd birthday party and he absolutely went above and beyond. He captured
                  every moment, made sure to get amazing candids of my guests and I, and got me the photos in less than
                  4 days! He was amazing and I will continue to recommend him to everyone I know.
